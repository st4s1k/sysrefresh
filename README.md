# sysrefresh
Handy installation script, that generates another script, that represents a command, which simplifies system update and upgrade on debian based distributions.

To install the script, execute this long command (it will prompt for root password):
```
git clone git@github.com:st4s1k/sysrefresh.git && cd sysrefresh/ && chmod +x sysrefresh_install && bash ./sysrefresh_install
```
